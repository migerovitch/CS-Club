How to get Git working on your computer
- Go to "Managed Software Center" on your computer
- Download "Git" and "GitHub Desktop"
- Go to github.com and make yourself an account
- Email me at migerovitch@students.natickps.org with your github username
- When I add you as a collaborator, you will recieve an email with an invitation
- Once this is done, go to our repository (project) page on github.com
- Press the green "Clone or download" button and then "Open in Desktop"
- Go to your GitHub Desktop Client and make sure that the project is configured correctly
- It should create a local copy on your computer (most likely in your /Documents/GitHub/ folder)
- In finder, find this local copy and add a folder called your name (ex. "John Smith's Folder")
- In this folder, create a TextEdit file with any random text called whatever you like. 
- Go to the GitHub Desktop Client:
	- In the bottom left hand corner, click commit
	- In the top bar click "push"
